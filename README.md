# ZeldaGame
Trying to make a zelda game in Java
#Instuctions
WASD are for movements. 
If the Enemy walks off the ledge with you the game will crash. 
The ESC key will exit the game. 
The space key is for attack but no animation were created only has a red box to show that it does have box of effect. 
If the box and the enemy collides there will be text saying "I got hit". 
The lines can be removed in the PlayState class. 
This class does the playing. 
I made multiply classes to be more organized compared to my Tank Game.
